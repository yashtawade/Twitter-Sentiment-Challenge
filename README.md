# Twitter_Sentiment-Challenge

The code in this repo is for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis challenge for the video 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology (Siraj Raval) on YouTube. Although not an official submission (I was late to discover these awesome challenges), this is my attempt at it. We use the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and extract tweets from Twitter and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each extracted tweet. Using TextBlob we'll be able to measure the polarity of each tweet depending on the topic we choose.
